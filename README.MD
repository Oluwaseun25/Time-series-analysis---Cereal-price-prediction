# Time Series Analysis - Predictive Modeling of Cereal Prices in Nigeria Using Spatio-Temporal Features 

The objective of this work is to use spatiotemporal features covering the years 2002â€“2024 to create a forecast model for cereal prices in Nigeria. To examine historical price data, the study makes use of machine learning techniques, particularly a hybrid model that combines Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on Time Series Analysis using **Statistical analysis** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. It leverages the **WFP Food Prices Dataset** to improve the accuracy of price predictions by combining economic data, commodity-specific characteristics, geospatial features, and temporal trends.

## Problem Statement
Market planning, economic forecasting, and food security are all severely hampered by Nigeria's grain price volatility (FAO, 2023). This price volatility is caused by a number of factors, such as seasonal production cycles, inflation rates, fluctuations in currency rates, transportation expenses, and shifts in governmental regulations. Because of the uncertainty created by these dynamic factors, farmers, traders, legislators, and consumers find it challenging to make wise judgments 

Predictive analytics research for agricultural markets has highlighted the value of hybrid models that blend structured learning strategies like XGBoost with deep learning methods like Long Short-Term Memory [LSTM] networks.
